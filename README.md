## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- vanilla javascript


### What I learned

i started adding utility classes to be reused throughout the page. It made things a bit easier. I practiced more on tabs.

### Continued development

i intend to continue exploring css, I want to start using sass in my future projects. I would also try to recreate the project with react when I'm more confident with it.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com) - This is a great resource when you need to remember a syntax or you're not too sure how to add a functionality or a css property.
